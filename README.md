# FARZI - Counterfeit Banknote Detection

FARZI is a counterfeit banknote detection system designed to test the authenticity of Indian currency notes. This project utilizes image processing techniques and computer vision algorithms to analyze the input image of a currency bill and provide a final result regarding its authenticity. The entire system is implemented in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks for code execution. Image processing is carried out with the OpenCV library, and the graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library.

## Overview

The primary objective of FARZI is to enhance security measures by creating a reliable system for distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit Indian currency notes. By leveraging various image processing and computer vision techniques, the system aims to identify key features and patterns that differentiate authentic bills from fraudulent ones.

## Features

- **Image Processing Techniques:** FARZI employs a range of image processing techniques to analyze currency bill images, extracting relevant information for further evaluation.

- **Computer Vision Algorithms:** The project utilizes computer vision algorithms to identify unique patterns, textures, and features present in authentic currency notes.

- **Python Implementation:** The entire system is coded in Python, providing flexibility and ease of integration with other projects or systems.

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The codebase is organized using Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to understand, modify, and experiment with different algorithms.

- **OpenCV Library:** OpenCV is utilized for its powerful image processing capabilities, facilitating tasks such as edge detection, contour analysis, and feature extraction.

- **Tkinter GUI:** The graphical user interface is developed using the Tkinter library, offering a user-friendly interaction with the counterfeit banknote detection system.
